The ultimate roll-rick

## How it works
1. First, it displays a fake checking your PC thing as preparation for the next step
2. Then, the "redirect" fails and the user presses the redirect link to be sent to the site
3. The so-called "redirect link" actually points to JS code that floods the site with autoplaying rickrolls with a small delay between them so the audio stacks up

The rick-roll is a self-hosted mp4 to reduce latency
